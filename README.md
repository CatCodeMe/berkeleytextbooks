# berkeleytextbooks
Textbooks and notes EE(CS) majors at Berkeley would find helpful. 

I plan to add resources for: 
 - CS61A () B (o) C ()
 - EE16A (o) B ()
 - CS70 ()
 - CS170 (o)
 - Physics7A (x) B (x) C (x)
 - CS162 (o)
 - CS188 (o)
 - CS186 (o)
 
 
x = In Progress;
o = Completed

Also: I may post some LaTeX templates I've used during my time here for courses like CS70, EE16A, CS170 ,etc. These will be on a separate branch if they do get uploaded.
